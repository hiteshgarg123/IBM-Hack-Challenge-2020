## Solution for IBM Hack challenge 2020

## Guidlines...

## General description:

An app to control overoccupancy in public transport post COVID-19. Timetable/schedule of the buses for the ease of passengers will be provided. Passengers will have to book their seats from the app in order to travel as there will be limited no. of seats.

### Working of the App

- Users will choose the source and destination location in the app.
- They will be presented with different transport options like BUSES and TRAINS ( TO be implemented ).
- Users will see the list of BUSES connecting source and destination through different routes.
- They can choose the BUS as per their convenience.
- After choosing the BUS they will be presented with the Route Map of that BUS.
- Users can see the current location of BUS ( On which stop BUS is currently present ) and time taken by it to REACH their STOP.
- Users then will be provided with "BOOK A SEAT" button and they can view the Seat Map of the BUS with VACANT and OCCUPIED seats.
- After booking a SEAT they will get a confirmation dialog.
- Users will have to show that dialog to conductor/driver of the BUS for their successful entry.
- The App will automatically update the seat as VACANT as soon as users will reach their destination.
- Additionally users can request for a stop.

### Additional features of the App (Admin's Pannel)

- There will be a different app for Admins ( Conductor and Drivers of BUSES )
- Admins can mark the seat as VACANT if a person booked a seat and doesn't appear on the STOP.
- They can mark a seat as VACANT if a passenger depart on middle of his/her journey.
- They can mark a SEAT as OCCUPIED if in case a person couldn't book a seat somehow and he/she needs one in the BUS ( provided there are already VACANT seats present in the BUS ).

 
## Novelty / Uniqueness:
The App Provide So much of features but in intial phase there
will be the following features:-<br/>
For Buses:<br/>
- The App Provide the option to choose from various root of the 
    source to destination.<br />
    User can select the buses from various options and can book their ticket 
    by App.<br/>In The App there will the options to choose the seat in seatmap view.
    They can choose their favourite seat as per availibility.<br />
- Users can see the live location of the buses.<br />
- The App will use the Deep-Learning model to moniter the Buses that 'Is every Passenger following
    the social distancing or not ?', If not then We can warn them by turning on the Buzzer or Horn.<br />
 

 
## Business / Social Impact:

The proposed solution will be able to monitor the number of passengers in a bus (maintaining social distancing).The given schedule of each bus timing will prove to be beneficial for people to plan their journey in advance. From the business point of view, there will be a high demand in the rise of number of buses since the number of passengers in each bus will be reduced. And, on the social front, the app will come handy in everyday use since it will keep a check on overoccupancy and social distancing.
